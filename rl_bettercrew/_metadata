  "description" : "Better Crew improves NPC AI, with special focus on crew member AI. With the base game behaviors, the crew tend to clump around the ship's teleporter because that is their \"home\" location. This mod dynamically and randomly sets crew member \"home\" locations to objects on the ship that are related to each crew member's assignment, resulting in a crew that moves about a well decorated ship more naturally.\n\nIn addition, a large number of other NPC behaviors have been improved, fixing numerous bugs and producing behavior that appears to be more realistic.\n\nFind more information, and the source code, at:\nhttps://github.com/rl-starbound/rl_bettercrew",
